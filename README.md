# Weather Forecast CLI :sunny: :cloud: :umbrella:

A simple weather app that provides current weather information for cities using geocoding and weather APIs.

## Features :sparkles:

- Fetch weather data based on city names or user location
- Display temperature and humidity information with color-coded formatting
- Supports multiple cities with the same name, allowing the user to select the desired city


## Installation :computer:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-app.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`


## Usage :sun_behind_small_cloud:

1. Run the app: `python weather_app.py city1 city2 city3`
   - Replace `city1`, `city2`, etc., with the names of the cities you want to get weather data for.
